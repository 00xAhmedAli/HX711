# HX711 Load Cell Interface

## Description

This project interfaces the HX711 load cell amplifier with an embedded system, allowing precise weight measurements. The implementation is designed for use with microcontrollers such as the ATmega32, STM32, or Arduino.

## Features

- Interface with HX711 using a microcontroller.
- Read and process weight data.
- Calibrate and convert raw readings to meaningful weight values.
- Low power consumption and real-time data processing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/00xAhmedAli/hx711.git
   cd hx711
   ```
2. Compile and flash the code to your microcontroller using your preferred development environment.
3. Connect the HX711 module according to the wiring diagram in the documentation.

## Usage

- Power on the system.
- The microcontroller will read and display the weight values.
- Use calibration functions to adjust readings.

## Hardware Requirements

- HX711 Load Cell Amplifier
- Load Cell Sensor
- Microcontroller (ATmega32, STM32, Arduino, etc.)
- Power supply (3.3V or 5V)

## Dependencies

- GCC for AVR/ARM (if using STM32 or ATmega32)
- STM32CubeIDE (for STM32)
- Arduino IDE (for Arduino users)
